# Downloads Auto Organizer 🧹

> "I hate cleaning my messy Downloads folder, so I automated it."

This project is my submission for **Kiro Week 2 – Lazy Automation**.

It is a simple Python script that:
- Scans your **Downloads** folder  
- Automatically categorizes files by type  
- Creates folders for Images, PDFs, Docs, Videos, Archives, Code, Others  
- Safely moves files without overwriting  

---

## ✨ Features
- Categorizes files by extension  
- Creates category folders automatically  
- Avoids overwriting (adds ` (1)`, `(2)`)  
- Skips hidden files  
- Pure Python (no external libraries needed)

## 🛠️ How to Run

```bash
python3 downloads_organizer.py
